Machine Learning Algorithms to predict fluctuations in blood sugar levels and provide personalized dietary suggestions for Type 2 Diabetics. The algorithms process 14-day time series glucose data on 100 patients using NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, and employ a four-layer deep neural network built with TensorFlow to predict blood-sugar spikes with 74% accuracy.

Updated code will be coming soon.
